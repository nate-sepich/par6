# Feature Specification: GitHub Copilot guidance and GitHub templates

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-github-copilot`  
**Created**: 2025-09-03  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create GitHub Copilot guidance files analogous to CLAUDE.md and CLAUDE.local.md, define .github/copilot-instructions.md for Copilot Chat usage, and propose PR/Issue templates referencing Spec-Driven Development and MCP tooling policies"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT these guidance files enable: consistent AI assistant and contributor behavior
- ‚ùå Avoid implementation specifics of CI or automation beyond files to create
- üë• Written for maintainers and contributors; keeps language clear and directive

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating guidance, do:
1. Carry forward policies in `CLAUDE.md` and `CLAUDE.local.md` (use AWS SAM MCP tools for backend; backend already deployed; env details live in `samconfig.toml`; Xcode for mobile)
2. Explicitly declare expectations for Copilot Chat interactions and guardrails
3. Reference Spec-Driven Development (scripts in `scripts/`) as the source of truth for feature work

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a maintainer, I want GitHub-native guidance so that GitHub Copilot Chat and contributors consistently follow our repository policies (SDD workflow, AWS SAM MCP tools usage, and environment context) without relying on external tools.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given a developer opens Copilot Chat in this repo, when they ask how to deploy the backend, then the assistant responds with "use AWS SAM MCP tools" and avoids direct AWS CLI/SAM CLI commands, reflecting `CLAUDE.md` guidance.
2. Given a contributor opens a new pull request, when they see the PR template, then it requires linking the feature spec (under `specs/###-.../spec.md`) and confirming SDD checklist items.
3. Given a user opens a new issue to request a feature, when the issue template loads, then it instructs them to use the Spec-Driven Development flow and/or provides a structured prompt for maintainers to convert into a spec.
4. Given a bug report is filed, when the template is used, then it captures environment info (iOS/SwiftUI app or backend env), reproduction steps, and expected vs actual behavior.

### Edge Cases
- External contributors without knowledge of SDD workflow need clear instructions in CONTRIBUTING and templates.
- Conflicting instructions between CLAUDE and Copilot guidance should be resolved by centralizing shared policies and pointing to one source of truth.
- Private/local-only rules: decide whether to keep a `.local` guidance file in-repo or in maintainers' private notes. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should local guidance live in-repo as `.github/COPILOT.local.md` or remain outside?]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- FR-001: Provide a GitHub-native Copilot guidance file that mirrors the intent and content of `CLAUDE.md` for Copilot Chat usage (project overview, architecture, dev workflow, key policies).
- FR-002: Ensure guidance explicitly states: use AWS SAM MCP tools for backend/API work; avoid raw AWS CLI/SAM CLI; backend is deployed; refer to `backend/samconfig.toml` for envs; open iOS project with Xcode for mobile work.
- FR-003: Add a PR template that requires linking the feature spec file, feature branch name, and completing a short checklist (spec ready, plan prepared, tests/docs considered).
- FR-004: Add Issue templates:
   - Feature request template that nudges SDD (or provides a structured intake for maintainers to turn into a spec).
   - Bug report template capturing repro, scope (backend/mobile), environment details, and expected vs. actual.
- FR-005: Add/Update CONTRIBUTING.md to describe the SDD workflow (scripts in `scripts/`, branch naming, spec location, planning), and reiterate the MCP tooling policy.
- FR-006: Centralize guidance to remove duplication between `CLAUDE.md` and Copilot guidance by pointing both to a shared policy section and keeping content consistent.
- FR-007: Ensure all added files live under `.github/` where applicable, using conventional file paths.

Examples of likely artifacts to create/update (subject to resolution):
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (Copilot Chat repo guidance; mirrors `CLAUDE.md` content & tone)
- `.github/COPILOT.local.md` (optional local/private addendum) [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` (PR checklist referencing SDD and spec links)
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md`
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`
- `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md` (SDD workflow, dev policies)
- `.github/CODEOWNERS` (optional) [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: owners?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]
